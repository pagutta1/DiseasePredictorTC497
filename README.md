## üí° Usage Examples

### Basic Prediction Example

```javascript
// Frontend usage with fetch API
const predictDisease = async (symptoms) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("http://localhost:8080/model", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        feature_matrix: ["placeholder", ...symptoms],
      }),
    });

    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Prediction failed:", error);
  }
};

// Usage
const symptoms = ["fever", "cough", "fatigue"];
const predictions = await predictDisease(symptoms);
console.log(predictions);
```

### Python Client Example

```python
import requests
import json

def predict_disease(symptoms):
    url = "http://localhost:8080/model"
    payload = {
        "feature_matrix": ["placeholder"] + symptoms
    }

    response = requests.post(url, json=payload)
    return response.json()

# Usage
symptoms = ["fever", "cough", "fatigue"]
predictions = predict_disease(symptoms)
print(f"Top prediction: {predictions['message']['0']}")
print(f"Confidence: {predictions['percentages']['0']:.2f}%")
```

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/model \

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### Medical & Safety

**Q: Is this a medical tool?**  
A: No, this is an educational project only. It should never be used for medical diagnosis, treatment, or any clinical decisions. Always consult qualified healthcare professionals for medical advice.

**Q: Can I use this for self-diagnosis?**  
A: Absolutely not. This tool is for learning purposes only. If you have health concerns, please see a licensed healthcare provider.

**Q: How accurate is the model?**  
A: Based on testing, the model achieves ~94.3% accuracy for top-1 predictions and ~100% accuracy for top-3 predictions on test data. However, these results are from a limited dataset and should not be considered medical-grade accuracy.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What symptoms are supported?**  
A: The model supports 100+ symptoms. Input should match the model's feature names (lowercased, with spaces converted to underscores). Unknown features are automatically ignored.

**Q: How are API keys and secrets handled?**  
A: All sensitive information is stored in `.env` files and accessed via `os.getenv()`. Never commit API keys to version control. Rotate any keys that may have been accidentally exposed.

**Q: What if the GPT API is unavailable?**  
A: The application will gracefully fall back to predictions without AI explanations. Core functionality remains available.

### Setup & Usage

**Q: Can I run this without the GPT integration?**  
A: Yes! The core prediction functionality works without GPT. Simply omit the GPT API configuration in your `.env` file.

**Q: What's the minimum system requirements?**  
A: Node.js 18+, Python 3.10+, and at least 2GB RAM. The model file is approximately 50MB.

**Q: How do I add new symptoms or diseases?**  
A: Currently, this requires retraining the model with new data. Future versions will include tools for easier model updates.

**Q: Can I deploy this to production?**  
A: This is designed as an educational project. For production use, you would need additional security, monitoring, and compliance measures.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: The Flask server won't start**  
A: Check that Python 3.10+ is installed, the virtual environment is activated, and all dependencies are installed. Ensure port 8080 is available.

**Q: The frontend can't connect to the backend**  
A: Verify that `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` in `.env.local` matches your Flask server URL and that the Flask server is running.

**Q: Predictions seem inaccurate**  
A: Remember this is an educational demo. The model was trained on limited data and may not reflect real-world medical accuracy.

**Q: How can I contribute to this project?**  
A: See the [Contributing](#-contributing) section below. We welcome bug reports, feature requests, and code contributions!


## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Future Plans

We will collect user data with consent to train our model on more disease and symptoms to increase our accuracy and repertoire. We plan to add a feature where users can upload their data to our firebase storage. Overall, we want people to have access to quick diagnosis from the click of a button to improve overall public health.

### Technical Implementation

- The model uses a Random Forest Classifier with GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization
- Frontend built with Next.js 13+ and TailwindCSS for a modern, responsive interface
- Backend uses Flask for lightweight API services
- U-M GPT integration provides natural language explanations for predictions
